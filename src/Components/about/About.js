                Apevolution club was previously known as Baby Apes Rescue. The
                rename marks the start of a new era of Apes.

                It began when a giant asteroid abruptly struck a volcano at the
                home of Baby Apes. The impact caused a volcano eruption which
                quickly turned into a massive forest fire. A total of 2500 baby
                apes were at risk of extinction but a group of apes from another
                tribe rescued them in time.

              <p>
                Amongst the survivors of the catastrophe was a Mad Scientist Ape
                who became obsessed with cloning himself to save his own kind
                for fear that another disaster may strike. He created a
                laboratory in his new home and began daily experimentation on
                different cloning methods in an attempt to clone his kind. On a
                fateful day, while conducting one of his many cloning
                experiments, he accidentally created a couple of strange species
                apart from his own kind.
